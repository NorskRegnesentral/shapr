Title: Prediction Explanation with Dependence-Aware Shapley Values
Description: Complex machine learning models are often hard to interpret. However, in 
  many situations it is crucial to understand and explain why a model made a specific 
  prediction. Shapley values is the only method for such prediction explanation framework 
  with a solid theoretical foundation. Previously known methods for estimating the Shapley 
  values do, however, assume feature independence. This package implements methods which accounts for any feature 
  dependence, and thereby produces more accurate estimates of the true Shapley values.
  An accompanying 'Python' wrapper ('shaprpy') is available through the GitHub repository.
