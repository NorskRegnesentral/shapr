Title: Explain the output of machine learning models with more accurately estimated Shapley values 
Description: Complex machine learning models are often hard to interpret. However, in 
  many situations it is crucial to understand and explain why a model made a specific 
  prediction. Shapley values is the only method for such prediction explanation framework 
  with a solid theoretical foundation. Previously known methods for estimating the Shapley 
  values do, however, assume feature independence. This package implements the method 
  described in Aas, Jullum and Løland (2019) <arXiv:1903.10464>, which accounts for any feature 
  dependence, and thereby produces more accuracte estimates of the true Shapley values.
