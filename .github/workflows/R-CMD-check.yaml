# 01.09.23: Moved from ubuntu-latest to ubuntu-20.04 to avoid actions being cancelled
# This is potentially due to CPU quota being exceeded as suggested

# July 5th, 2022: This is a modifided version of the 'check-standard' version from
# https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples#standard-ci-workflow

# The following is modified:

# 1. Runs on branches cranversion and devel as well
# 2. Runs on oldrel-2 as well
# 3. R CMD check is performed WITHOUT the default as-cran flag. This allows snapshots to run without setting
#    as-cran=TRUE in every single call to expect_snapshot


# Workflow derived from https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2/examples
# Need help debugging build failures? Start at https://github.com/r-lib/actions#where-to-find-help
