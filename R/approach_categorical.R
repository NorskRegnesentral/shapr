#'
#' @param categorical.epsilon Numeric value. (Optional)
#' If \code{joint_probability_dt} is not supplied, probabilities/frequencies are

#' then epsilon is used as the proportion of times that these observations occurs in the training data.
#' In theory, this proportion should be zero, but this causes an error later in the Shapley computation.
