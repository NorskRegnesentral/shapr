#' Create marginal categorical data for causal Shapley values
#'
#' @description
#' This function is used when we generate marginal data for the categorical approach when we have several sampling
#' steps. We need to treat this separately, as we here in the marginal step CANNOT make feature values such
#' that the combination of those and the feature values we condition in S are NOT in
#' `categorical.joint_prob_dt`. If we do this, then we cannot progress further in the chain of sampling
#' steps. E.g., X1 in (1,2,3), X2 in (1,2,3), and X3 in (1,2,3).
#' We know X2 = 2, and let causal structure be X1 -> X2 -> X3. Assume that
#' P(X1 = 1, X2 = 2, X = 3) = P(X1 = 2, X2 = 2, X = 3) = 1/2. Then there is no point
#' generating X1 = 3, as we then cannot generate X3.
#' The solution is only to generate the values which can proceed through the whole
#' chain of sampling steps. To do that, we have to ensure the the marginal sampling
#' respects the valid feature coalitions for all sets of conditional features, i.e.,
#' the features in `features_steps_cond_on`.
#' We sample from the valid coalitions using the MARGINAL probabilities.
#'
#' @param Sbar_features Vector of integers containing the features indices to generate marginal observations for.
#' That is, if `Sbar_features` is `c(1,4)`, then we sample `n_MC_samples` observations from \eqn{P(X_1, X_4)}.
#' That is, we sample the first and fourth feature values from the same valid feature coalition using
#' the marginal probability, so we do not break the dependence between them.
#' @param S_original Vector of integers containing the features indices of the original coalition `S`. I.e., not the
#' features in the current sampling step, but the features are known to us before starting the chain of sampling steps.
