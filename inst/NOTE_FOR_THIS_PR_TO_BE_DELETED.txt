Further work

1. Get testing of custom models to work, then add tests for passing custom model that stops or gives messages when calling BOTH get_data_specs and get_model_specs, and check_features
3. Consider restructuring preprocess_data not using so many different functions
4. Update make_data and apply_data using the functions in preprocess_data.
5. Consider adding an option to skip
6. Update vignette and shapr::shapr-documentation on how to make custom model, including the optional get_model_specs stuff
7. Consider adding options check_feature_classes + check_factor_levels to shapr which are automatically enforced if the model class does not
    have this kind of information. These should be added to the ouput of get_model_features and passed on to check_features.
8. Restructure tests so that testing is carried out in the main functions.
9. Run checks
10. run lintr and styler in the end

11. Check whether I should rather pass the feature list stemming from the data, rather than the model on from shapr, since in the case where
    the model does not have this information (ranger or xgboost), the train data and test data should at least have the same format.
    Could do it just in those cases and provide a message that this is done, and a name passed alongside this list instead of those passed
    manually to check_features.
