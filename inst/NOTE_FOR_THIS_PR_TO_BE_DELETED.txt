Further work

1. Get testing of custom models to work, then add tests for passing custom model that stops or gives messages when calling BOTH get_data_specs and get_model_specs, and check_features
3. Consider restructuring preprocess_data not using so many different functions
4. Update make_data and apply_data using the functions in preprocess_data.
5. Consider adding an option to skip
6. Update vignette and shapr::shapr-documentation on how to make custom model, including the optional get_model_specs stuff
7. Consider adding options check_feature_classes + check_factor_levels to shapr which are automatically enforced if the model class does not
    have this kind of information. These should be added to the ouput of get_model_features and passed on to check_features.
8. Restructure tests so that testing is carried out in the main functions.
9. Run checks
10. run lintr and styler in the end
