Further work

#1. can we merge update_data to check_features (need to see how htis works out after using check_features in make_dummies) -- no this is not possible
2. Removing feature_labels option and requiring get_model_specs function as well. This will simplify error messages, code base and --
   I can anyway provide a set of minimal custom functions for this type.
2.5 Check WHEN use_1_as truth is used, and see if you can replace it with something more intuitve based on when it used and not.
3. Update vignette and shapr::shapr-documentation on how to make custom model, including the optional get_model_specs stuff
3.5. Update documentation, examples etc.
4. Restructure tests so that testing is carried out in the main functions -- and remove unused ones.
5. Get testing of custom models to work, then add tests for passing custom model that stops or gives messages when calling BOTH get_data_specs and get_model_specs, and check_features
6. Run checks
7. run lintr and styler for the full pacakge in another PR
