Further work

#1. can we merge update_data to check_features (need to see how htis works out after using check_features in make_dummies) -- no this is not possible
#2. Removing feature_labels option and requiring get_model_specs function as well. This will simplify error messages, code base and --
#   I can anyway provide a set of minimal custom functions for this type.
2.5 Check WHEN use_1_as truth is used, and see if you can replace it with something more intuitve based on when it used and not.
3. Update vignette and shapr::shapr-documentation on how to make custom model, deleting all traces of feature_labels and make it pass,
  including all required stuff for custom models
  it is important that these examples are very good. Provide a full one for all of gbm + a minimal one just to get that specific model type through.
#3.2 Add possibility in check_features that only the factor levels from a model might be unknown (NA) and that the factor levels form the training data is used.
3.5. Update documentation, examples etc.
4. Restructure tests so that testing is carried out in the main functions -- and remove unused ones.
5. Get testing of custom models to work, then add tests for passing custom model that stops or gives messages when calling BOTH get_data_specs and get_model_specs, and check_features
  If it don't get it to work, make set of maual tests that checks stuff for custom models in a single script outside of testthat. Note that you should at least have some custom
  model stuff that actually should pass (not just failing ones.)
6. Run checks
7. run lintr and styler for the full pacakge in another PR
