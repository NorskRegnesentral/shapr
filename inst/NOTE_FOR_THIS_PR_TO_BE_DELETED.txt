NOTE: In this PR I will do

1. within shapr and explain, check that the factors have the same levels as provided in the model objects
  a.  check if input is data.frame/data.table or matrix. If matrix, do nothing
      if data.frame, convert to data.table, then
      check which factors are specified in the model object (dummylist for xgboost, something else in lm and glm),
      and then check if that matches the data. This COULD be done within the features-functions,
      separately extracing AND checking within the individual functions.
      A better approach is perhaps to make a check_features function, which does the checking and will call the features
      function which are simplified to only return lists with the different features, their class and if factors,
      also their levels. Other packages must have the same "problem". Maybe I can see how this is
      done in e.g. lime.


        -- this could be specified
