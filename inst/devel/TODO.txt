- summary.shapr
- Start with a basic "Summary of Shapley value explanation" or so
- put the content of the cli_startup function in another function which both cli_startup and summary.shapr can call (cli_overview or so, need not to be exported)
- summary.shapr should also have info on the number of coalitions used and what kind of convergence was used if iterative = TRUE
- should call  get_results and return all of that as a list
-
  - Then also display the estimated Shapley values (if not using all, then with sd in paranethsis, provided show_sd = TRUE (defaults to NULL which shows it if exact = FALSE),
                                                    DONT DO THIS AFTER ALL AS print_iter is already exported! -Move print_iter to cli.R (and rename to cli_iter_conv or cli_iter_res). Remember to update the python function as well.

                                                    - Add examples to print, get and summary.
                                                    - Add tests
                                                    - Add illustrations in the basic vignettes
                                                    - Rerun all vignettes if output is changed
