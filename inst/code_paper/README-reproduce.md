# Reproduction guidelines

Below we describe how to reproduce the code and figure examples in the paper
"shapr: Explaining Machine Learning Models with Conditional Shapley Values in R and Python"

*The instructions assume a Linux-like environment and that the commands are executed from the directory containing this file.*
*Execution from other locations or on different operating systems requires adjustments.*

*The code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS with R 4.4.1 and Python 3.12.7 installed.*

## Folder content

The folder contains the following files:

- `README-reproduce.md`: This file.

#### Code files
- `code_R.R`: The R code used to generate the results and figures in the paper.
- `code_py.py`: The Python code used to generate the results and figures in the paper.
- `R_prep_data_and_model.R`: An R script that generates the data and models used in the examples, and save them in the `data_and_models` directory (i.e. it is not necessary to run this script).
- `code_py_to_html.sh`: A bash script that converts the Python code to HTML using `jupytext` and `nbconvert`.

#### Output files and folders
- `data_and_models/`: A folder containing the data and models used in the examples, as generated by `R_prep_data_and_model.R`.
- `code_R.html`: The HTML file generated by `code_R.R`, containing the R code, its output and basic session information.
- `code_py.html`: The HTML file generated by `code_py_to_html.sh` bash script, containing the Python code, its output and basic session information.
- `paper_figures/`: A folder containing the figures for the examples used in the paper, generated by `code_R.R`.
- `html_figures/`: A folder containing the figures for the examples used in the HTML file, generated by `code_R.R`.

## R
To reproduce the R examples and figures, make sure you have installed the `shapr` package, its required packages, in addition to the following packages from CRAN: `xgboost`, `ctree`, `future`, `progressr`, `markdown`, `knitr` and `patchwork`.

Then, from the command line, run
```
Rscript R_prep_data_and_model.R
```
This will prepare the data and model files used by both the R and Python examples, and save them in the `data_and_models` folder.
It also creates the `R_paper_figures` and `R_html_figures` folders.

To run the R code and generate the HTML file with the code and output in the actual paper, run
```
Rscript -e "knitr::spin('code_R.R')"
```
This will generate the file `code_R.html` containing the code from `code_R.R` accompanied with its output, as well as the figures in the `R_paper_figures` and `R_html_figures` folders.

**Note:** 
The html file shows the code used in the paper together with its output. Additional code used to mildly customize and save the figures is provided in the `code_R.R` file and executed by `knitr::spin()`, but not shown in the html-file.

## Python

To reproduce the Python examples, make sure you have installed the `shaprpy` Python library and its required packages (in addition to the `shapr` R package).

To simplify the reproducability, we have created a simple bash script executing the Python code in a manner similar to how the `knitr::spin()` function operates for the `R` code.
The bash script requires the `jupytext` `nbconvert` and `session_info` libraries to run.
They can installed with `pip` as follows:

```
pip install jupytext nbconvert session_info
```

Then, from the command line, run
```
bash code_py_to_html.sh
```
This will generate the file `code_py.html` containing the code from `code_py.py` accompanied with it's output and basic session information.
