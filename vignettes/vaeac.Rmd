<a id="intro"></a>

In this vignette, we elaborate and illustrate the `vaeac` approach in more depth than in the general usage vignette.
In the general usage vignette, only a few basic examples of using `vaeac` are included, while we showcase more
advanced usage here. See the overview above for which topics are covered in this vignette.



# Vaeac {#vaeac}

An approach that supports mixed features is the Variational AutoEncoder
with Arbitrary Conditioning (@olsen2022using), abbreviated to `vaeac`.
The `vaeac` is an extension of the regular variational autoencoder
(@kingma2014autoencoding), but instead of giving a probabilistic representation
of the distribution $p(\boldsymbol{x})$ it gives a probabilistic representation
of the conditional distribution
$p(\boldsymbol{x}_{\bar{\mathcal{S}}} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{\mathcal{S}})$,
for all possible feature subsets $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{M}$ simultaneously,
where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of all features. That is, only a single `vaeac`
model is needed to model all conditional distributions.

The `vaeac` consists of three neural networks: a *full encoder*, a *masked encoder*,
and a *decoder*. The encoders map the full and masked/conditional input representations,
i.e., $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}_{\mathcal{S}}$, respectively,
to latent probabilistic representations. Sampled instances from these latent probabilistic
representations are sent to the decoder, which maps them back to the feature space
and provides a sampleable probabilistic representation for the unconditioned features
$\boldsymbol{x}_{\bar{\mathcal{S}}}$. The full encoder is only used during the
training phase of the `vaeac` model to guide the training process of the masked encoder,
as the former relies on the full input sample $\boldsymbol{x}$, which is not accessible
in the deployment phase (when we generate the Monte Carlo samples), as we only have access
to $\boldsymbol{x}_{\mathcal{S}}$. The networks are trained by minimizing a variational
lower bound, and see Section 3 in @olsen2022using for an in-depth introduction to the
`vaeac` methodology. We use the `vaeac` model at the epoch which obtains the lowest
validation IWAE score to generate the Monte Carlo samples used in the Shapley value computations.

We fit the `vaeac` model using the *torch* package in $\textsf{R}$ (@torch). The main
parameters are the number of layers in the networks (`vaeac.depth`), the width of the layers
(`vaeac.width`), the number of dimensions in the latent space (`vaeac.latent_dim`),
the activation function between the layers in the networks (`vaeac.activation_function`),
the learning rate in the ADAM optimizer (`vaeac.lr`), the number of `vaeac` models to initiate
to remedy poorly initiated model parameter values (`vaeac.n_vaeacs_initialize`), and
the number of learning epochs (`vaeac.epochs`). Call `?shapr::setup_approach.vaeac` for
a more detailed description of the parameters.

There are additional extra parameters which can be set by including a named list in the call to
the `explain()` function. For example, we can change the batch size to 32 by including
`vaeac.extra_parameters = list(vaeac.batch_size = 32)` as a parameter in the call to the `explain()` function.
See `?shapr::vaeac_get_extra_para_default` for a description of the possible extra parameters to the `vaeac` approach.
The main parameters are entered directly into the `explain()` function,
while the extra parameters are included in a named list called `vaeac.extra_parameters`.

# Code Examples {#code}
We now demonstrate the `vaeac` approach on several different use cases.
Note that this vignette runs on CPU, but all code sections below can be run on GPU too.
To enable GPU, we have to include `vaeac.extra_parameters = list(vaeac.cuda = TRUE)`
in the calls to the `explain()` function.


## Basic Example {#basicexample}
Here we go through how to use the `vaeac` approach on the same data as in the general usage

First we load the shapr package

``` r
library(shapr)
```

First we set up the model we want to explain.


``` r
library(xgboost)
library(data.table)

data("airquality")
data <- data.table::as.data.table(airquality)
data <- data[complete.cases(data), ]

x_var <- c("Solar.R", "Wind", "Temp", "Month")
y_var <- "Ozone"

ind_x_explain <- 1:6
x_train <- data[-ind_x_explain, ..x_var]
y_train <- data[-ind_x_explain, get(y_var)]
x_explain <- data[ind_x_explain, ..x_var]

# Fitting a basic xgboost model to the training data
model <- xgboost(
  x = x_train,
  y = y_train,
  nround = 100,
  verbosity = 0
)

# Specifying the phi_0, i.e. the expected prediction without any features
phi0 <- mean(y_train)
```


## First vaeac example


We are now going to explain predictions made by the model using the `vaeac` approach.


``` r
n_MC_samples <- 25 # Low number of MC samples to make the vignette build faster
vaeac.n_vaeacs_initialize <- 2 # Initialize several vaeacs to counteract bad initialization values
vaeac.epochs <- 4 # The number of training epochs

explanation <- explain(
  model = model,
  x_explain = x_explain,
  x_train = x_train,
  approach = "vaeac",
  phi0 = phi0,
  seed = 1,
  n_MC_samples = n_MC_samples,
  vaeac.epochs = vaeac.epochs,
  vaeac.n_vaeacs_initialize = vaeac.n_vaeacs_initialize
)

We can look at the Shapley values.

## Pre-trained vaeac {#pretrained_vaeac}
If the user has a pre-trained `vaeac` model (from a previous run), the user can send that to the `explain()` function
and `shapr` will skip the training of a new `vaeac` model and rather use the provided `vaeac` model. This is useful
if we want to explain new predictions using the same combinations/coalitions as previously, i.e., we have a new
`x_explain`. Note that the new `x_explain` must have the same features as before.

The `vaeac` model is accessible via `explanation$internal$parameters$vaeac`.
Note that if we let `'vS_details' %in% verbose` in `explain()`, then `shapr` will give a message
that it loads a pretrained `vaeac` model instead of training it from scratch.

In this example, we extract the trained `vaeac` model from the previous example and send it to `explain()`.


``` r
# Send the pre-trained vaeac model
expl_pretrained_vaeac <- explain(
  model = model,
  x_explain = x_explain,
  x_train = x_train,
  approach = "vaeac",
  phi0 = phi0,
  seed = 1,
  n_MC_samples = n_MC_samples,
  vaeac.extra_parameters = list(
    vaeac.pretrained_vaeac_model = explanation$internal$parameters$vaeac
  )
)

#> [1] TRUE
```

## Pre-trained vaeac (path) {#pretrained_vaeac_path}
We can also just provide a path to the stored `vaeac` model. This is beneficial if we have only stored the `vaeac`
model on the computer but not the whole `explanation` object. The possible save paths are stored in
`explanation$internal$parameters$vaeac$model`. Note that if we let `'vS_details' %in% verbose` in `explain()`, then `shapr` will give
a message that it loads a pretrained `vaeac` model instead of training it from scratch.


``` r
# Call `explanation$internal$parameters$vaeac$model` to see possible vaeac models. We use `best` below.
# Send the pre-trained vaeac path
expl_pretrained_vaeac_path <- explain(
  model = model,
  x_explain = x_explain,
  x_train = x_train,
  approach = "vaeac",

  seed = 1,
  n_MC_samples = n_MC_samples,

```



## Specified max_n_coalitions {#n_coalitions}

In this section, we discuss a general `shapr` parameter in the `explain()` function
that is method independent, namely, `max_n_coalitions`.
The user can limit the Shapley value computations to only a subset of coalitions by setting the
`max_n_coalitions` parameter to a value lower than $2^{n_\text{features}}$.

Note that we do not need to train a new `vaeac` model as we can use the one above trained on
all `16` coalitions as we are now only using a subset of them. This is not applicable the other
way around.


``` r
# Send the pre-trained vaeac path
expl_batches_coalitions <- explain(
  model = model,
  x_explain = x_explain,
  x_train = x_train,
  approach = "vaeac",
  phi0 = phi0,
  seed = 1,
  max_n_coalitions = 10,
  n_MC_samples = n_MC_samples,
  vaeac.extra_parameters = list(
    vaeac.pretrained_vaeac_model = explanation$internal$parameters$vaeac

```

Note that if we train a `vaeac` model from scratch with the setup above, then the `vaeac` model will not use
an MCAR (missing completely at random) mask generator, but rather a mask generator that ensures that the `vaeac`
model is only trained on the specified set of coalitions. In this case, it will be the set of the sampled coalitions.

## Paired sampling {#paired_sampling}

The `vaeac` approach can use paired sampling to improve the stability of the vaeac training procedure.
When using paired sampling, each observation in the training batches will be duplicated, but the first version will
be masked by $S$ and the second version will be masked by the complement $\bar{S}$. The masks are taken from the
`explanation$internal$objects$S` matrix. Note that `vaeac` does not check if the complement is also in said matrix.
This means that if the Shapley value explanations are computed based on a subset of coalitions, then the `vaeac` model might be trained on coalitions which are not used when
computing the Shapley values. This should not be considered as redundant training as it increases the stability and
performance of the `vaeac` model as a whole; hence, we recommend using paired sampling (default). Furthermore, the masks
are randomly selected for each observation in the batch. The training time when using paired sampling is higher in
comparison to random sampling due to more complex implementation.

We can compare the results by looking at the training and validation errors and by the $MSE_v$ evaluation criterion.
We do this by using the `plot_vaeac_eval_crit()` and `plot_MSEv_eval_crit()` functions in the `shapr` package,
respectively.

``` r
explanation_list <- list("Regular samp." = expl_paired_sampling_FALSE,
                         "Paired samp." = expl_paired_sampling_TRUE)
plot_vaeac_eval_crit(explanation_list, plot_type = "criterion")
```

![](figure_vaeac/paired-sampling-plotting-1.webp)

``` r
plot_MSEv_eval_crit(explanation_list)
```

![](figure_vaeac/paired-sampling-plotting-2.webp)

By looking at the time, we see that the paired version takes (a bit) longer time in the `setup_computation`
phase, that is, in the training phase.

``` r
rbind(
  "Paired" = expl_paired_sampling_TRUE$timing$overall_timing_secs,
  "Regular" = expl_paired_sampling_FALSE$timing$overall_timing_secs

## Progressr {#progress_bar}
As discussed in the general usage, the `shapr` package provides two ways for receiving information about the progress
of the approach. First, the `shapr` package provides progress updates of the computation of the Shapley values through
the `progressr` package. Second, the user can also get various form of information through `verbose` in `explain()`.
By letting `'vS_details' %in% verbose`, we get extra information related to the `vaeac` approach.
The `verbose` parameter works independently of the `progressr` package.
Meaning that the user can chose to use none, either, or both options simultaneously.
We give two examples here, and refer the reader to the general usage for more detailed information.

By setting `c("basic", "vS_details")`, we get both basic messages about the explanation case and
messages about the estimation of the `vaeac` approach.

``` r
expl_with_messages <- explain(
  model = model,
  x_explain = x_explain,
  x_train = x_train,
  approach = "vaeac",
  phi0 = phi0,
  seed = 1,
  n_MC_samples = n_MC_samples,
  verbose = c("basic","vS_details"),
  vaeac.epochs = 5,
  vaeac.n_vaeacs_initialize = 2
)

```
For more visual information we can use the `progressr` package.
This can help us see detailed progress of the training step for the final `vaeac` model.
Note that by default `vS_details` is not part of `verbose`, meaning that we do not get any messages from the `vaeac`
approach and only get the progress bars. See the general usage for examples for how to change the progress bar.

## Continue the training of the vaeac approach {#continue_training}

In the case the user has set a too low number of training epochs and sees that the network is still learning,
then the user can continue to train the network from where it stopped. Thus, a good workflow can therefore
be to call the `explain()` function with `n_MC_samples = 1` (to avoid spending too much time generating MC samples),
then look at the training and evaluation plots of the `vaeac`. If not satisfied, then train more. If satisfied,
then call the `explain()` function again, but this time using the extra parameter `vaeac.pretrained_vaeac_model`,
as illustrated above. Note that we have set the number of `vaeac.epochs` to be very low in this example and we
recommend using many more epochs.

We can compare the results by looking at the training and validation errors and by the $MSE_v$ evaluation criterion.
We do this by using the `plot_vaeac_eval_crit()` and `plot_MSEv_eval_crit()` functions in the `shapr` package,
respectively. We also use the `plot_vaeac_imputed_ggpairs()` function which generates samples from $p(x)$, this
is meant as a sanity check to see that the `vaeac` model is able to follow the general structure/distribution of the
data. However, recall that the `vaeac` model is never trained on the empty coalition, so the produced samples should be taken with a grain of salt.

changed, but they are often comparable.

## Vaeac with early stopping {#early_stopping}
If we do not want to specify the number of `epochs`, as we are uncertain how many `epochs` it will take before the
`vaeac` model is properly trained, a good choice is to rather use early stopping. This means that we can set
`vaeac.epochs` to a large number and let `vaeac.epochs_early_stopping` be for example `5`. This means that the `vaeac`
model will stop the training procedure if there has been no improvement in the validation score for `5` epochs.


``` r

```

![](figure_vaeac/early-stopping-1-1.webp)

However, we can train it further for a fixed amount of epochs if desired. This can be in a setting where we are not
happy with the IWAE curve or we feel that we set `vaeac.epochs_early_stopping` to a too low value or if the max
number of epochs (`vaeac.epochs`) were reached.

``` r
# Make a copy of the explanation object which we are to train further.
expl_early_stopping_train_more <- expl_early_stopping

# Continue to train the vaeac model some more epochs
expl_early_stopping_train_more$internal$parameters$vaeac <-
  vaeac_train_model_continue(
    explanation = expl_early_stopping_train_more,
    epochs_new = 15,
    x_train = x_train,
    verbose = NULL
  )

# Can even do it twice if desired
expl_early_stopping_train_more$internal$parameters$vaeac <-
  vaeac_train_model_continue(
    explanation = expl_early_stopping_train_more,
    epochs_new = 10,
    x_train = x_train,

  )

  list(

    "Vaeac early stopping more epochs" = expl_early_stopping_train_more
  ),
  plot_type = "method"
)
```

![](figure_vaeac/early-stopping-2-1.webp)

We can then use the extra trained version to compute the Shapley value explanations and compare it with the previous
version that used early stopping. We see a non-significant difference.

``` r

## Grouping of features {#grouping_of_features}
When we train a `vaeac` model to explain groups of features, then the `vaeac` model will use
the "Specified_masks_mask_generator", which ensures that the `vaeac` model only trains on a specified set of coalitions.
In this case, it will ensure that all features in group A will always either be conditioned on or be unconditioned.
The same goes for group B. Note that in this setup, there are only `4` possible coalitions, but `vaeac` only trains on
`2` coalitions as the empty and grand coalitions as they are not needed in the Shapley value computations.

## Mixed Data {#mixed_data}
Here we look at a setup with mixed data, i.e., the data contains both categorical and continuous features.
First we set up the data and the model.

``` r
library(ranger)
#> ranger 0.17.0 using 2 threads (default). Change with num.threads in ranger() and predict(), options(Ncpus = N), options(ranger.num.threads = N) or environment variable R_RANGER_NUM_THREADS.
data <- data.table::as.data.table(airquality)
data <- data[complete.cases(data), ]

# Convert the month variable to a factor
data[, Month_factor := as.factor(Month)]

x_var_cat <- c("Solar.R", "Wind", "Temp", "Month_factor")
y_var <- "Ozone"

ind_x_explain <- 1:6

data_train_cat <- data[-ind_x_explain, ]
x_train_cat <- data_train_cat[, ..x_var_cat]
x_explain_cat <- data[ind_x_explain, ][, ..x_var_cat]

# Fit a random forest model to the training data
model <- ranger(as.formula(paste0(y_var, " ~ ", paste0(x_var_cat, collapse = " + "))),
  data = data_train_cat
)

# Specifying the phi_0, i.e. the expected prediction without any features
phi0 <- mean(data_train_cat[, get(y_var)])
```
Then we compute explanations using the `ctree` and `vaeac` approaches. For the `vaeac` approach, we
consider two setups: the default architecture, and a simpler one without skip connections. We do this
to illustrate that the skip connections improve the `vaeac` method. We use `ctree` with default parameters.


``` r
# Here we use the ctree approach
expl_ctree <- explain(
  model = model,
  x_explain = x_explain_cat,
  x_train = x_train_cat,
  approach = "ctree",
  phi0 = phi0,
  seed = 1,
  n_MC_samples = 250
)
