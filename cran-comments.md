## Resubmission

This is a resubmission with the following changes:

# Revision round 2

* Revised what is specified as internal/non-internal functions, and added 
  examples such that all non-internal exported functions now have examples.
* I am not quite sure exactly what the "writing to disk" issue refers to, but
  we are using testthat::expect_known_value in our tests, which is overwriting
  certain .rds-files if and only if the test fails. I changed the default 
  behavior so that it no longer overwrites the files. We also have some
  scripts under inst/scripts that writes to disk. These are now added to 
  .Rbuildignore. Please let me know more precisely what the issue is if these
  fixes are not satisfactory.
* Deleted a call to rm(list=ls()) in a script under inst/scripts. I could not
  find any other modifications of .GlobalEnv in the vignette as suggested.

# Revision round 1

* Reduced title length
* Removed examples from unexported functions
* Changed one unexported function to exported and added test (not requested)
* Converted cat-printed console message to message()
* Added Norsk Regnesentral as "author"" (copyrightholder and funder)
* Could not find any packages being installed in functions, examples or 
  vignette as suggested. However, there was a script under inst/devel that 
  installed packages. This script is now deleted.
* Updated cran-comments.md and NEWS.md
