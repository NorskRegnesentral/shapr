## Resubmission

This is a resubmission with the following changes:

# Revision round 2

* Revised what is specified as internal/non-internal functions, and added 
  examples such that all non-internal exported functions now have examples.
* I could not find any writing to disk in examples/vignettes/tests as suggested.
  There are scripts under inst/scripts which writes to disk. These scripts are 
  creating objects which are loaded in the tests and therefore handy for 
  package development. Note that we are also using testthat::expect_known_value
  in our tests, this function is overwriting .rds-objects if and only if
  the test fails. Please let me know more precisely what the issue is, if it
  persists after this re-submission.
* Deleted a call to rm(list=ls()) in a script under inst/scripts. I could not
  find any other modifications of .GlobalEnv in the vignette as suggested.

# Revision round 1


* Reduced title length
* Removed examples from unexported functions
* Changed one unexported function to exported and added test (not requested)
* Converted cat-printed console message to message()
* Added Norsk Regnesentral as "author"" (copyrightholder and funder)
* Could not find any packages being installed in functions, examples or 
  vignette as suggested. However, there was a script under inst/devel that 
  installed packages. This script is now deleted.
* Updated cran-comments.md and NEWS.md
