predictions(model, D, h_optim_vec, kernel_metric, S, Xtrain, Xtest,
  w_threshold = 0.7, noSamp_MC = 1000, verbose = FALSE,
  cond_approach_list, feature_list, pred_zero, mu, Sigma,

}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model object. Fitted model that is used to produce the predictions}

\item{D}{Matrix}

\item{kernel_metric}{String indicating which kernel metric should be used in the empirical
conditional distribution. Defaults to "Gaussian" [\eqn{\exp(-D/2\sigma)}], with "independence"
(imputing independently, ignoring any distance) being the second option "Gaussian_old"
[\eqn{\sqrt(\exp(-D/2\sigma))}] is also kept for reproducibility.}

\item{S}{Matrix}

\item{Xtrain}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features from the training data}

\item{Xtest}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features, whose predictions ought to
be explained (test data)}

\item{noSamp_MC}{Positive integer. Indicating the maximum number of samples to use in the
Monte Carlo integration for every conditional expectation (previously called \code{n_threshold})}

\item{verbose}{Integer. How much information to print during function execution (in development)}

\item{feature_list}{List}

\item{pred_zero}{Numeric}

\item{mu}{Numeric vector. (Optional) Containing the mean of the data generating distribution.
NULL means it is estimated from the data if needed (in the Gaussian approach).}

\item{Sigma}{Numeric matrix. (Optional) Containing the covariance matrix of the data generating
distribution. NULL means it is estimated from the data if needed (in the Gaussian approach).}

\item{Xtest_Gauss_trans}{Vector with the Gaussian transformed test observations}
