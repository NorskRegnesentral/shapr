\usage{
observation_impute(W_kernel, S, Xtrain, Xtest, w_threshold = 0.7,
  noSamp_MC = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{W_kernel}{Array. Contains all nonscaled weights between training and testing observations
for all combinations.}

\item{S}{Matrix}

\item{Xtrain}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features from the training data}

\item{Xtest}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features, whose predictions ought to
be explained (test data)}

\item{noSamp_MC}{Positive integer. Indicating the maximum number of samples to use in the
Monte Carlo integration for every conditional expectation (previously called \code{n_threshold})}
