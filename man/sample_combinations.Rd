\title{Helper function to sample a combination of training and testing rows, which does not risk
getting the same observation twice. Need to improve this help file.}
\usage{
sample_combinations(nTrain, nTest, nosamp, separate = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{separate}{Logical indicating whether the train and test data should be sampled separately
or in a joint sampling space. If they are sampled separately (which typically would be used when
optimizing more than one distribution at once) we sample with replacement if more samples than
training data. Not optimal, but for now fine if careful when using more samples than the number
training observations while at the same time doing optimization over every test observation.}
