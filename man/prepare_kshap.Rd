\title{Get Shapley weights for test data}
\usage{
prepare_kshap(Xtrain, Xtest, exact = TRUE, noSamp = NULL,
  shapley_weight_inf_replacement = 10^6,
  compute_distances_for_no_var = 0:ncol(Xtrain))
}
\arguments{
\item{Xtrain}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features from the training data}

\item{Xtest}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features, whose predictions ought to
be explained (test data)}

\item{exact}{Logical. If TRUE, uses the full sum in the Shapley formula, if FALSE, uses a
sampling approach to approximate the sum}

\item{noSamp}{Integer. How many samples to use when approximating the sum in the Shapley formula
(previously called \code{nrows})}

\item{shapley_weight_inf_replacement}{Numeric. Indicating which weight to use for the full
conditional and unconditional expectations in kernel SHAPs weighted least squares formulation.}

\item{compute_distances_for_no_var}{If equal to \code{NULL} no distances are computed}
}
\value{
Matrix
