\title{Get Shapley weights for test data}
\usage{
prepare_kshap(xtrain, xtest, exact = TRUE, no_samp = NULL,
  shapley_weight_inf_replacement = 10^6,
  compute_distances_for_no_var = 0:ncol(xtrain))
}
\arguments{
\item{xtrain}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features from the training data}

\item{xtest}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features, whose predictions ought
to be explained (test data)}

\item{exact}{Logical. If TRUE, uses the full sum in the Shapley formula, if FALSE, uses a
sampling approach to approximate the sum}

\item{no_samp}{Integer. How many samples to use when approximating the sum in the Shapley
formula
(previously called \code{nrows})}

\item{shapley_weight_inf_replacement}{Numeric. Indicating which weight to use for the full
conditional and unconditional expectations in kernel SHAPs weighted least squares formulation.}
