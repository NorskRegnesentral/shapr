\arguments{
\item{model}{The model whose predictions we want to explain.
Run \code{\link[=get_supported_models]{get_supported_models()}}
for a table of which models \code{explain} supports natively. Unsupported models
can still be explained by passing \code{predict_model} and (optionally) \code{get_model_specs},
see details for more information.}

\item{y}{Matrix, data.frame/data.table or a numeric vector.
Contains the endogenous variables used to estimate the (conditional) distributions
needed to properly estimate the conditional expectations in the Shapley formula
including the observations to be explained.}

\item{xreg}{Matrix, data.frame/data.table or a numeric vector.
Contains the exogenous variables used to estimate the (conditional) distributions
needed to properly estimate the conditional expectations in the Shapley formula
including the observations to be explained.
As exogenous variables are used contemporaneusly when producing a forecast,
this item should contain nrow(y) + horizon rows.}

\item{train_idx}{Numeric vector
The row indices in data and reg denoting points in time to use when estimating the conditional expectations in
the Shapley value formula.
If \code{train_idx = NULL} (default) all indices not selected to be explained will be used.}

\item{explain_idx}{Numeric vector
The row indices in data and reg denoting points in time to explain.}

\item{explain_y_lags}{Numeric vector.
Denotes the number of lags that should be used for each variable in \code{y} when making a forecast.}

\item{explain_xreg_lags}{Numeric vector.
If \code{xreg != NULL}, denotes the number of lags that should be used for each variable in \code{xreg} when making a forecast.}

\item{horizon}{Numeric.
The forecast horizon to explain. Passed to the \code{predict_model} function.}

\item{approach}{Character vector of length \code{1} or one less than the number of features.
All elements should, either be \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"copula"}, \code{"empirical"}, \code{"ctree"}, \code{"vaeac"},
\code{"categorical"}, \code{"timeseries"}, \code{"independence"}, \code{"regression_separate"}, or \code{"regression_surrogate"}.
The two regression approaches can not be combined with any other approach. See details for more information.}

\item{prediction_zero}{Numeric.
The prediction value for unseen data, i.e. an estimate of the expected prediction without conditioning on any
features.
Typically we set this value equal to the mean of the response variable in our training data, but other choices
such as the mean of the predictions in the training data are also reasonable.}

\item{max_n_coalitions}{Integer.
The upper limit on the number of unique feature/group coalitions to use in the adaptive procedure
(if \code{adaptive = TRUE}).
If \code{adaptive = FALSE} it represents the number of feature/group coalitions to use directly.
The quantity refers to the number of unique feature coalitions if \code{group = NULL},
and group coalitions if \code{group != NULL}.
\code{max_n_coalitions = NULL} corresponds to \code{max_n_coalitions=2^n_features}.}

\item{group_lags}{Logical.
If \code{TRUE} all lags of each variable are grouped together and explained as a group.
If \code{FALSE} all lags of each variable are explained individually.}

\item{group}{List.
If \code{NULL} regular feature wise Shapley values are computed.
If provided, group wise Shapley values are computed. \code{group} then has length equal to
the number of groups. The list element contains character vectors with the features included
in each of the different groups.}

\item{n_MC_samples}{Positive integer.
Indicating the maximum number of samples to use in the  Monte Carlo integration for every conditional expectation.
For \code{approach="ctree"}, \code{n_MC_samples} corresponds to the number of samples
from the leaf node (see an exception related to the \code{ctree.sample} argument \code{\link[=setup_approach.ctree]{setup_approach.ctree()}}).
For \code{approach="empirical"}, \code{n_MC_samples} is  the \eqn{K} parameter in equations (14-15) of
Aas et al. (2021), i.e. the maximum number of observations (with largest weights) that is used, see also the
\code{empirical.eta} argument \code{\link[=setup_approach.empirical]{setup_approach.empirical()}}.}

\item{seed}{Positive integer.
Specifies the seed before any randomness based code is being run.
If \code{NULL} no seed is set in the calling environment.}

\item{keep_samp_for_vS}{Logical.
Indicates whether the samples used in the Monte Carlo estimation of v_S should be returned (in \code{internal$output}).
Not used for \code{approach="regression_separate"} or \code{approach="regression_surrogate"}.}

\item{predict_model}{Function.
The prediction function used when \code{model} is not natively supported.
(Run \code{\link[=get_supported_models]{get_supported_models()}} for a list of natively supported models.)
The function must have two arguments, \code{model} and \code{newdata} which specify, respectively, the model
and a data.frame/data.table to compute predictions for.
The function must give the prediction as a numeric vector.
\code{NULL} (the default) uses functions specified internally.
Can also be used to override the default function for natively supported model classes.}

\item{get_model_specs}{Function.
An optional function for checking model/data consistency when \code{model} is not natively supported.
(Run \code{\link[=get_supported_models]{get_supported_models()}} for a list of natively supported models.)
The function takes \code{model} as argument and provides a list with 3 elements:
\describe{
\item{labels}{Character vector with the names of each feature.}
\item{classes}{Character vector with the classes of each features.}
\item{factor_levels}{Character vector with the levels for any categorical features.}
}
If \code{NULL} (the default) internal functions are used for natively supported model classes, and the checking is
disabled for unsupported model classes.
Can also be used to override the default function for natively supported model classes.}

\item{verbose}{An integer specifying the level of verbosity. If \code{0}, \code{shapr} will stay silent.
If \code{1}, it will print information about performance. If \code{2}, some additional information will be printed out.
Use \code{0} (default) for no verbosity, \code{1} for low verbose, and \code{2} for high verbose.
TODO: Make this clearer when we end up fixing this and if they should force a progressr bar.}

TODO: Describe better what the methods do here.}
    \item{\code{empirical.eta}}{Numeric. (default = 0.95)
Needs to be \verb{0 < eta <= 1}.
Represents the minimum proportion of the total empirical weight that data samples should use.
If e.g. \code{eta = .8} we will choose the \code{K} samples with the largest weight so that the sum of the weights
accounts for 80\\% of the total weight.
\code{eta} is the \eqn{\eta} parameter in equation (15) of Aas et al (2021).}

Start value of the \code{sigma} parameter when optimizing the AICc.

    \item{\code{empirical.cov_mat}}{Numeric matrix. (Optional, default = NULL)

    \item{\code{ctree.mincriterion}}{Numeric scalar or vector. (default = 0.95)
Either a scalar or vector of length equal to the number of features in the model.
Value is equal to 1 - \eqn{\alpha} where \eqn{\alpha} is the nominal level of the conditional independence tests.
If it is a vector, this indicates which value to use when conditioning on various numbers of features.}
    \item{\code{ctree.minsplit}}{Numeric scalar. (default = 20)
Determines minimum value that the sum of the left and right daughter nodes required for a split.}
    \item{\code{ctree.minbucket}}{Numeric scalar. (default = 7)

    \item{\code{ctree.sample}}{Boolean. (default = TRUE)
If TRUE, then the method always samples \code{n_MC_samples} observations from the leaf nodes (with replacement).
If FALSE and the number of observations in the leaf node is less than \code{n_MC_samples},
the method will take all observations in the leaf.
If FALSE and the number of observations in the leaf node is more than \code{n_MC_samples},
the method will sample \code{n_MC_samples} observations (with replacement).
This means that there will always be sampling in the leaf unless
\code{sample} = FALSE AND the number of obs in the node is less than \code{n_MC_samples}.}
    \item{\code{vaeac.depth}}{Positive integer (default is \code{3}). The number of hidden layers

    \item{\code{categorical.joint_prob_dt}}{Data.table. (Optional)
Containing the joint probability distribution for each combination of feature
values.
\code{NULL} means it is estimated from the \code{x_train} and \code{x_explain}.}
    \item{\code{categorical.epsilon}}{Numeric value. (Optional)
If \code{joint_probability_dt} is not supplied, probabilities/frequencies are
estimated using \code{x_train}. If certain observations occur in \code{x_train} and NOT in \code{x_explain},
then epsilon is used as the proportion of times that these observations occurs in the training data.
In theory, this proportion should be zero, but this causes an error later in the Shapley computation.}

Represents the kernel bandwidth in the distance computation. TODO: What length should it have? 1?}
    \item{\code{timeseries.bounds}}{Numeric vector of length two. (Default = c(NULL, NULL))
If one or both of these bounds are not NULL, we restrict the sampled time series to be
between these bounds.
This is useful if the underlying time series are scaled between 0 and 1, for example.}

\description{
Computes dependence-aware Shapley values for observations in \code{explain_idx} from the specified
\code{model} by using the method specified in \code{approach} to estimate the conditional expectation.
}
\details{
This function explains a forecast of length \code{horizon}. The argument \code{train_idx}
is analogous to x_train in \code{explain()}, however, it just contains the time indices of where
in the data the forecast should start for each training sample. In the same way \code{explain_idx}
defines the time index (indices) which will precede a forecast to be explained.

As any autoregressive forecast model will require a set of lags to make a forecast at an
arbitrary point in time, \code{explain_y_lags} and \code{explain_xreg_lags} define how many lags
are required to "refit" the model at any given time index. This allows the different
approaches to work in the same way they do for time-invariant models.
