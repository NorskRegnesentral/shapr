\arguments{
\item{model}{The model whose predictions we want to explain.
Run \code{\link[=get_supported_models]{get_supported_models()}}
for a table of which models \code{explain} supports natively. Unsupported models
can still be explained by passing \code{predict_model} and (optionally) \code{get_model_specs},
see details for more information.}

\item{data}{TODO: Write}

\item{reg}{TODO: Write}

\item{train_idx}{TODO: Write}

\item{explain_idx}{TODO: Write}

\item{lags}{TODO: Write}

\item{horizon}{TODO: Write}

\item{approach}{Character vector of length \code{1} or \code{n_features}.
\code{n_features} equals the total number of features in the model. All elements should,
either be \code{"gaussian"}, \code{"copula"}, \code{"empirical"}, \code{"ctree"}, \code{"categorical"}, \code{"timeseries"}, or \code{"independence"}.
See details for more information.}

\item{prediction_zero}{Numeric.
The prediction value for unseen data, i.e. an estimate of the expected prediction without conditioning on any
features.
Typically we set this value equal to the mean of the response variable in our training data, but other choices
such as the mean of the predictions in the training data are also reasonable.}

\item{n_combinations}{Integer.
If \code{group = NULL}, \code{n_combinations} represents the number of unique feature combinations to sample.
If \code{group != NULL}, \code{n_combinations} represents the number of unique group combinations to sample.
If \code{n_combinations = NULL}, the exact method is used and all combinations are considered.
The maximum number of combinations equals \code{2^m}, where \code{m} is the number of features.}

\item{group_lags}{TODO: Write}

\item{n_samples}{Positive integer.
Indicating the maximum number of samples to use in the
Monte Carlo integration for every conditional expectation. See also details.}

\item{n_batches}{Positive integer.
Specifies how many batches the total number of feature combinations should be split into when calculating the
contribution function for each test observation.
The default value is 1.
Increasing the number of batches may significantly reduce the RAM allocation for models with many features.
This typically comes with a small increase in computation time.}

\item{seed}{Positive integer.
Specifies the seed before any randomness based code is being run.
If \code{NULL} the seed will be inherited from the calling environment.}

\item{keep_samp_for_vS}{Logical.
Indicates whether the samples used in the Monte Carlo estimation of v_S should be returned
(in \code{internal$output})}

\item{predict_model}{Function.
The prediction function used when \code{model} is not natively supported.
(Run \code{\link[=get_supported_models]{get_supported_models()}} for a list of natively supported
models.)
The function must have two arguments, \code{model} and \code{newdata} which specify, respectively, the model
and a data.frame/data.table to compute predictions for. The function must give the prediction as a numeric vector.
\code{NULL} (the default) uses functions specified internally.
Can also be used to override the default function for natively supported model classes.}

\item{get_model_specs}{Function.
An optional function for checking model/data consistency when \code{model} is not natively supported.
(Run \code{\link[=get_supported_models]{get_supported_models()}} for a list of natively supported
models.)
The function takes \code{model} as argument and provides a list with 3 elements:
\describe{
\item{labels}{Character vector with the names of each feature.}
\item{classes}{Character vector with the classes of each features.}
\item{factor_levels}{Character vector with the levels for any categorical features.}
}
If \code{NULL} (the default) internal functions are used for natively supported model classes, and the checking is
disabled for unsupported model classes.
Can also be used to override the default function for natively supported model classes.}
