\usage{
prepare_data_copula_cpp_caus(

  mu,

}
\arguments{
\item{MC_samples_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_explain}, \code{n_features}) containing samples from the
univariate standard normal. The i'th row will be applied to the i'th row in \code{x_explain_mat}.}

\item{x_explain_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_explain}, \code{n_features}) containing the observations to
explain on the original scale. The MC sample for the i'th explicand is based on the i'th row in \code{MC_samples_mat}.}

\item{x_explain_gaussian_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_explain}, \code{n_features}) containing the
observations to explain after being transformed using the Gaussian transform, i.e., the samples have been
transformed to a standardized normal distribution.}

\item{x_train_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_train}, \code{n_features}) containing the training observations.}

\item{S}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_coalitions}, \code{n_features}) containing binary representations of
the used coalitions. S cannot contain the empty or grand coalition, i.e., a row containing only zeros or ones.
This is not a problem internally in shapr as the empty and grand coalitions treated differently.}

\item{mu}{arma::vec. Vector of length \code{n_features} containing the mean of each feature after being transformed
using the Gaussian transform, i.e., the samples have been transformed to a standardized normal distribution.}

\item{cov_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_features}, \code{n_features}) containing the pairwise covariance
between all pairs of features after being transformed using the Gaussian transform, i.e., the samples have been
transformed to a standardized normal distribution.}
}
\value{
An arma::mat/2D array of dimension (\code{n_explain} * \code{n_coalitions}, \code{n_features}),
where the rows (n_explain * S_ind, n_explain * (S_ind + 1) - 1) contains the single
conditional Gaussian MC samples for each explicand and \code{S_ind} coalition.
