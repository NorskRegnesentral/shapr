\title{Calculate Shapley weight}
\usage{
shapley_weights(m, N, n_components, weight_zero_m = 10^6)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Positive integer. Total number of features/feature groups.}

\item{N}{Positive integer. The number of unique combinations when sampling \code{n_components} features/feature
groups, without replacement, from a sample space consisting of \code{m} different features/feature groups.}

\item{n_components}{Positive integer. Represents the number of features/feature groups you want to sample from
a feature space consisting of \code{m} unique features/feature groups. Note that \verb{ 0 < = n_components <= m}.}

\item{weight_zero_m}{Positive integer. Represents the Shapley weight for two special
cases, i.e. the case where you have either \code{0} or \code{m} features/feature groups.}
