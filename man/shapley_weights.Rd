\title{Calculate Shapley weight}
\usage{
shapley_weights(m, N, s, weight_zero_m = 10^6)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Positive integer. Total number of features.}

\item{N}{Positive integer. The number of unique combinations when sampling \code{s} features,
without replacement, from a sample space consisting of \code{m} different features.}

\item{s}{Positive integer. Represents the number of features you want to sample from a feature
space consisting of \code{m} unique features. Note that \code{ 0 < = s  <= m}.}

\item{weight_zero_m}{Positive integer. Represents the Shapley weight for two special
cases, i.e. the case where you have either \code{0} or \code{m} features.}
