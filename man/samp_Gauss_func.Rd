\usage{
samp_Gauss_func(given_ind, noSamp_MC, mu, Sigma, p, Xtest,
  ensure_condcov_symmetry = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{given_ind}{Vector}

\item{noSamp_MC}{Positive integer. Indicating the maximum number of samples to use in the Monte Carlo integration for every conditional expectation (previously called \code{n_threshold})}

\item{mu}{Numeric vector. (Optional) Containing the mean of the data generating distribution. NULL means it is estimated from the data if needed (in the Gaussian approach).}

\item{Sigma}{Numeric matrix. (Optional) Containing the covariance matrix of the data generating distribution. NULL means it is estimated from the data if needed (in the Gaussian approach).}

\item{p}{Positive integer}

\item{Xtest}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table with the features, whose predictions ought to be explained (test data)}
}
\value{
data.table with \code{noSamp_MC} (conditional) Gaussian samples
}
