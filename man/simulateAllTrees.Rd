\usage{
simulateAllTrees(
  given_ind,
  x_train,
  comb_indici,
  comb_mincriterion,
  mincriterion,
  minsplit,
  minbucket
)
}
\arguments{
\item{given_ind}{Numeric value. Indicates which features are conditioned on.}

\item{x_train}{Numeric vector. Indicates the specific values of features for individual i.}

\item{comb_indici}{Numeric value. (Optional) Contains the splitting point corresponding to where to change the
\code{comb_mincriterion}.
If \code{NULL}, the \code{mincriterion} is constant for every combination.
This is depreciated and will be deleted soon.}

\item{comb_mincriterion}{Numeric vector. (Optional) Contains the different mincriterions to use for each
combination.
If \code{NULL}, the \code{mincriterion} is constant for every combination.
This is depreciated and will be deleted soon.}

\item{mincriterion}{Numeric value or vector equal to 1 - alpha where alpha is the nominal level of the conditional
independence tests.
Can also be a vector equal to the length of the number of features indicating which mincriterion to use
when conditioning on various numbers of features.}

\item{minsplit}{Numeric value. Equal to the value that the sum of the left and right daughter nodes need to exceed.}

\item{minbucket}{Numeric value. Equal to the minimum sum of weights in a terminal node.}
}
\value{
List with conditional inference tree and the variables conditioned/not conditioned on.
