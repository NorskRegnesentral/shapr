\usage{
prepare_data_copula_cpp(
  MC_samples_mat,
  x_explain_mat,
  x_explain_gaussian_mat,

  mu,

}
\arguments{
\item{MC_samples_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_samples}, \code{n_features}) containing samples from the
univariate standard normal.}

\item{x_explain_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_explain}, \code{n_features}) containing the observations
to explain on the original scale.}

\item{x_explain_gaussian_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_explain}, \code{n_features}) containing the
observations to explain after being transformed using the Gaussian transform, i.e., the samples have been
transformed to a standardized normal distribution.}

\item{x_train_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_train}, \code{n_features}) containing the training observations.}

\item{S}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_combinations}, \code{n_features}) containing binary representations of
the used coalitions. S cannot contain the empty or grand coalition, i.e., a row containing only zeros or ones.
This is not a problem internally in shapr as the empty and grand coalitions treated differently.}

\item{mu}{arma::vec. Vector of length \code{n_features} containing the mean of each feature after being transformed
using the Gaussian transform, i.e., the samples have been transformed to a standardized normal distribution.}

\item{cov_mat}{arma::mat. Matrix of dimension (\code{n_features}, \code{n_features}) containing the pairwise covariance
between all pairs of features after being transformed using the Gaussian transform, i.e., the samples have been
transformed to a standardized normal distribution.}
}
\value{
An arma::cube/3D array of dimension (\code{n_samples}, \code{n_explain} * \code{n_coalitions}, \code{n_features}), where
the columns (\emph{,j,}) are matrices of dimension (\code{n_samples}, \code{n_features}) containing the conditional Gaussian
copula MC samples for each explicand and coalition on the original scale.
