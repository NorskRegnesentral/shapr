\title{Check that all explicands has at least one valid MC sample in causal Shapley values}
\usage{
check_categorical_valid_MCsamp(
  dt,
  n_explain,
  n_MC_samples,
  joint_probability_dt
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{Data.table containing the generated MC samples (and conditional values) after each sampling step}

\item{n_explain}{Integer. The number of explicands/observations to explain.}

\item{n_MC_samples}{Positive integer.
Indicating the maximum number of samples to use in the  Monte Carlo integration for every conditional expectation.
For \code{approach="ctree"}, \code{n_MC_samples} corresponds to the number of samples
from the leaf node (see an exception related to the \code{ctree.sample} argument \code{\link[=setup_approach.ctree]{setup_approach.ctree()}}).
For \code{approach="empirical"}, \code{n_MC_samples} is  the \eqn{K} parameter in equations (14-15) of
Aas et al. (2021), i.e. the maximum number of observations (with largest weights) that is used, see also the
\code{empirical.eta} argument \code{\link[=setup_approach.empirical]{setup_approach.empirical()}}.}
