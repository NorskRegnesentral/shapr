\usage{
compute_kshap(model, l, noSamp_MC = 1000, verbose = FALSE,
  cond_approach = "empirical", empirical_settings = list(type =
  "fixed_sigma", fixed_sigma_vec = 0.1, AICc_no_samp_per_optim = 1000,
  AIC_optim_max_eval = 20, AIC_optim_startval = 0.1, w_threshold = 0.95),
  pred_zero, mu = NULL, Sigma = NULL, ensure_condcov_symmetry = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model object. Fitted model that is used to produce the predictions}

\item{l}{List. The output from the \code{prepare_kshap} function}

\item{noSamp_MC}{Positive integer. Indicating the maximum number of samples to use in the
Monte Carlo integration for every conditional expectation (previously called \code{n_threshold})}

\item{verbose}{Integer. How much information to print during function execution (in development)}

\item{cond_approach}{String or list. When being a list, the elements in the list refers to the
rows in l$X that ought to be included in each of the approaches!}

\item{empirical_settings}{List. Specifying the settings when using the empirical method to
compute the conditional expectations.}

\item{pred_zero}{The prediction value for unseen data, typically equal to the mean of the
response}

\item{mu}{Numeric vector. (Optional) Containing the mean of the data generating distribution.
NULL means it is estimated from the data if needed (in the Gaussian approach).}

\item{Sigma}{Numeric matrix. (Optional) Containing the covariance matrix of the data generating
distribution. NULL means it is estimated from the data if needed (in the Gaussian approach).}

\item{ensure_condcov_symmetry}{Logical. Whether to ensure that the conditional covariance
matrices in the Gaussian and copula approaches are symmetric. Typically only needed if the
original covariance is just barely positive definite.}
}
\value{
List with kernel SHAP values (\code{Kshap}) and other object used to perform
the computation (helpful for debugging etc.)
}
\description{
Computes kernel SHAP values for test data
}
\details{
If \code{cond_approach} is a list, the elements in the list refers to the rows in
\code{l$X} that ought to be included in each of the approaches!
