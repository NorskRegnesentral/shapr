# A [`torch::nn_module()`](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/reference/nn_module.html) Representing a gauss_cat_sampler_random

The `gauss_cat_sampler_random` generates random samples from the
generative distribution defined by the output of the vaeac. The random
sample is generated by sampling from the inferred Gaussian and
categorical distributions for the continuous and categorical features,
respectively.

## Usage

``` r
gauss_cat_sampler_random(
  one_hot_max_sizes,
  min_sigma = 1e-04,
  min_prob = 1e-04
)
```

## Arguments

- one_hot_max_sizes:

  A torch tensor of dimension `n_features` containing the one hot sizes
  of the `n_features` features. That is, if the `i`th feature is a
  categorical feature with 5 levels, then `one_hot_max_sizes[i] = 5`.
  While the size for continuous features can either be `0` or `1`.

- min_sigma:

  For stability it might be desirable that the minimal sigma is not too
  close to zero.

- min_prob:

  For stability it might be desirable that the minimal probability is
  not too close to zero.
