## Brief NEWS

This is `shapr` version 1.0.0, which provides a full suit of new functionality. 
See  the [NEWS](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/shapr/blob/master/NEWS.md) for details

### Breaking change (June 2023)

As of version 0.2.3.9000, the development version of shapr (master branch on GitHub from June 2023) has been severely restructured, introducing a new syntax for explaining models, and thereby introducing a range of breaking changes. This essentially amounts to using a single function (`explain()`) instead of two functions (`shapr()` and `explain()`).
The CRAN version of `shapr` (v0.2.2) still uses the old syntax. 
The examples below uses the new syntax. 
[Here](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/shapr/blob/cranversion_0.2.2/README.md) is a version of this README with the syntax of the CRAN version (v0.2.2).

### Python wrapper

As of version 0.2.3.9100 (master branch on GitHub from June 2023), we provide a Python wrapper (`shaprpy`) which allows explaining python models with the methodology implemented in `shapr`, directly from Python. The wrapper is available [here](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/shapr/tree/master/python). See also details in the [NEWS](https://github.com/NorskRegnesentral/shapr/blob/master/NEWS.md).


## The package

The shapr R package implements an enhanced version of the KernelSHAP method, for approximating Shapley values, 
with a strong focus on conditional Shapley values. 
The core idea is to remain completely model-agnostic while offering a variety of methods for estimating contribution 
functions, enabling accurate computation of conditional Shapley values across different feature types, dependencies, 
and distributions. 
The package also includes evaluation metrics to compare various approaches. 
With features like parallelized computations, convergence detection, progress updates, and extensive plotting options, 
shapr is as a highly efficient and user-friendly tool, delivering precise estimates of conditional Shapley values, 
which are critical for understanding how features truly contribute to predictions.

A basic example is provided below. 
Otherwise we refer to the [pkgdown website](https://norskregnesentral.github.io/shapr/) and the vignettes there  
for details and further examples.


## Installation

To install the current stable release from CRAN (note, using the old explanation syntax), use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("shapr")
```

To install the current development version (with the new explanation syntax), use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("NorskRegnesentral/shapr")
```

If you would like to install all packages of the models we currently support, use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("NorskRegnesentral/shapr", dependencies = TRUE)
```


If you would also like to build and view the vignette locally, use 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("NorskRegnesentral/shapr", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
vignette("understanding_shapr", "shapr")
```

You can always check out the latest version of the vignette [here](https://norskregnesentral.github.io/shapr/articles/understanding_shapr.html). 

## Example
`shapr` supports computation of Shapley values with any predictive model which takes a set of numeric features and produces a numeric outcome. 

The following example shows how a simple `xgboost` model is trained using the *airquality* dataset, and how `shapr` explains the individual predictions. 


```{r basic_example, warning = FALSE}
library(xgboost)
library(shapr)

data("airquality")
data <- data.table::as.data.table(airquality)
data <- data[complete.cases(data), ]

x_var <- c("Solar.R", "Wind", "Temp", "Month")
y_var <- "Ozone"

ind_x_explain <- 1:6
x_train <- data[-ind_x_explain, ..x_var]
y_train <- data[-ind_x_explain, get(y_var)]
x_explain <- data[ind_x_explain, ..x_var]

# Looking at the dependence between the features
cor(x_train)

# Fitting a basic xgboost model to the training data
model <- xgboost(
  data = as.matrix(x_train),
  label = y_train,
  nround = 20,
  verbose = FALSE
)

# Specifying the phi_0, i.e. the expected prediction without any features
p0 <- mean(y_train)

# Computing the actual Shapley values with kernelSHAP accounting for feature dependence using
# the empirical (conditional) distribution approach with bandwidth parameter sigma = 0.1 (default)
explanation <- explain(
  model = model,
  x_explain = x_explain,
  x_train = x_train,
  approach = "empirical",
  phi0 = p0
)

# Printing the Shapley values for the test data.
# For more information about the interpretation of the values in the table, see ?shapr::explain.
print(explanation$shapley_values_est)

# Finally we plot the resulting explanations
plot(explanation)
```

examples.
